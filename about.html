      <p class="about-intro">
        Welcome to <strong>The Fractal Garden</strong>, a living collection of generative and algorithmic art — a digital ecosystem where mathematics becomes motion, and code becomes creation.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        I’m <strong>Udantha</strong>, a 29-year-old developer and visual experimenter with a deep fascination for <em>fractal geometry</em>, <em>chaos theory</em>, and <em>emergent design</em>. 
        What began as simple sketches in Python and JavaScript has evolved into an exploration of how algorithms can mimic nature — not by copying it, but by <strong>growing</strong> their own digital life.
      </p>

      <h2>How These Artworks Are Created</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        Every piece in this garden starts as <strong>code</strong> — a few lines of logic, geometry, and randomness. I use <strong>p5.js</strong>, a JavaScript library built on the Processing framework, to generate visuals in real time. 
        No image files. No Photoshop. Each pattern is born fresh every time you open the page.
      </p>

      <ul class="about-list">
        <li>Recursive algorithms that branch like trees or neurons.</li>
        <li>Trigonometric transformations that simulate waves, light, and gravity.</li>
        <li>Perlin noise to introduce natural randomness — the same technique used in terrain generation and particle motion.</li>
        <li>Dynamic parameters that evolve frame by frame, creating the illusion of breathing, pulsing, or growing.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="about-text">
        Some artworks are generated from <strong>fractal math</strong> — self-repeating formulas that produce infinite complexity from simple rules. 
        Others are built on <strong>vector fields</strong>, <strong>particle systems</strong>, and <strong>noise-driven motion</strong>, combining structure and chaos to form something organic, almost alive.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        I’m experimenting with integrating audio-reactive systems using the <strong>Web Audio API</strong>, allowing these artworks to analyze live sound frequencies and amplitudes in real time. 
        Each visual element — motion, brightness, color shift, or particle behavior — could then dynamically respond to beats, bass, and harmonic energy, effectively making the art “listen” and evolve with music. 
        The system reads frequency data (bass, mid, and treble) through an <strong>AnalyserNode</strong>, outputs waveform amplitude, and maps those values to parameters inside the p5.js sketches — such as movement, scale, or color — creating a living, sound-responsive visual experience.
      </p>

      <h2>The Vision</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        I see <em>The Fractal Garden</em> as more than an art gallery — it’s a <strong>sandbox of digital life</strong>, an experiment in how beauty can emerge from code alone. 
        With just a few variables changed — angle, length, color, speed — an entirely new organism appears. 
        That’s the magic of generative art: you never really “finish” a piece; you <strong>grow</strong> it.
      </p>

      <h2>Future Growth</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        In future versions, I plan to:
      </p>
      <ul class="about-list">
        <li>Allow visitors to <strong>edit parameters live</strong> — evolve artworks in real time.</li>
        <li>Release <strong>downloadable visual packs</strong> for desktops or live wallpapers.</li>
        <li>Open-source select algorithms for others to learn from and remix.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="about-text closing-line">
        Every seed of math in this garden has infinite potential.  
        All it needs is code, curiosity, and time to grow.
